Entity: Globalcare
Version: v1.0

This document formally freezes the Globalcare prompt set used for
AISO benchmarking and attribution testing.

The prompt set includes:
- 15 Must-Mention prompts
- 10 Optional-Mention prompts
- 5 Must-Not-Mention prompts

Rules:
1. No prompts in this set may be changed, added, removed, or reworded.
2. Only scoring, results, and analysis may change.
3. Any future prompt changes require a new version number and freeze record.

Purpose:
To ensure benchmarking results are repeatable, auditable, and defensible
for commercial, investor, and technical evaluation.

This freeze applies across all baseline and post-publish tests.
